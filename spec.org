* Goals
  * To follow a sound data mining application development process
  * To develop models that will generalise well to new data
  * To write a clear report on your findings
** Learning outcomes
   * Demonstrate understanding of complete data mining process
   * Clearly articulate pattern analysis principles
   * Application of multiple data mining methods
     * Preprocessing
     * Exploration
     * Modeling
* Task
  Determination of properties of protein sequences.
** Problem
   Experimenting is expensive and time-consuming
*** Computational approaches
    Become increasingly relevant
** Coursework
   Exploring related dataset
*** linear B-Cell enitopes
    Region of proteins that can have applications in immunology
*** Data
**** Two groups
***** Training set
***** Test set
**** Classification goal
     Predict as accurately as possible whether a given observation is a positive epitope or not.
* Tips
** Data mining process
*** Carry out in systematic way
*** Take good notes of what you've done
*** Save data & models reguarly
    For easy experiment repeating
**** Remeber RNG seeds for full reproducibility!
** Exploration and preprocessing
   As important as models themselves
*** Explore dataset with visualisation tools
*** Consider careful treatment of outliers/missing data/etc.
*** Document analysis decisions
    Need to be justified in report
*** If pre-processing...
    Distinct models have different preprocessing steps
**** Explore options before deciding on steps
** Experiment with Weka
*** Wide range of techniques available
*** Possible ideas
**** Feature extraction & selection
**** Model combination
**** Classifiers not covered in module
*** Describe what you do clearly
*** Evaluate models consistently
*** When using preprocessing filters
    Use /Filtered Classifier/ to ensure preprocessing is applied consistently to all datasets.
**** Save time
**** Make analysis reproducible
** [#A] Two distinct classification problems
*** Equal misclassification costs
*** Cost matrix
    Misclassifying /Positive/ is four times greater than misclassifying /Negative/
** [#A] Individual vs Group
   2 vs 4 models for each classification task
** Parameter tuning
   Don't settle for standard options of each model
*** Must tune at least one model for each classification task
**** TODO COMMENT Classification task = cost problems?
** Comparing models
   Select best one for both problems
*** Selected models make predictions on test set
**** [#A] Evaluations
***** Equal cost
      Evaluated in terms of accuracy
***** Unequal cost
      Total misclassification cost on prediction (test) set
** Weka interfaces
   Try to utilise the best of each one
*** Explorer
    Preliminary exploration for data preprocessing and modeling approaches
*** Experimenter
    * Automate repetitive experiments
    * Statistical comparisons maybe useful for model selection
